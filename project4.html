    <h1>Litigation Support – San Diego, Ca</h1>
    <div id="issue">
        <h2>Issue:</h2>
        <h3>This newly constructed estate home had excellent curb appeal, but shortly after the owners moved in they started to notice things were not quite right. Their instincts led them to seek expert advice as to what may be going on with their dream home. The very short discovery period turned into a substantial remediation and construction repair process.</h3>
        <h3>ACC quickly discovered completely failed exterior building envelope systems including, roofing, windows and doors, elevated decks, as well as stucco and stone cladding. The ensuing damage from these failed assemblies was all-encompassing, rendering this home completely uninhabitable.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="resolution">
        <h2>Resolution:</h2>
        <h3>The level of damage gave rise to the owners bringing legal action against the builder/developer and various subcontractors. ACC was instrumental in deriving a favorable outcome for the owners by providing expert testimony and the following litigation support services:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provided 558 notice and meeting support at the direction of legal counsel</li>
            <li>Provided building envelope defect and damage analysis</li>
            <li>Provided structural defect and damage analysis</li>
            <li>Prepared detailed photo documentation</li>
            <li>Prepared construction defect and damage mapping</li>
            <li>Provided reconstruction cost analysis</li>
